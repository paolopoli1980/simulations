This simulation is about the spin-magnetic interactions considered in a lattice grid.
Starting from the hamiltonian where is possible to consider the classic magnetic dipole
interactions, Heisenberg interactions, and isotropic interactions, the evolution of
that system has simulated showing it with a graphic interface developed using Vpython
library.
